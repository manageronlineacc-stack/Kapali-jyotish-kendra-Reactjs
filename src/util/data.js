    faqTitle: 'What can I expect astrology to tell me?',
    faqContent: <>
    Astrology is meant only for some categories of people which I explained thus:<br/> 
    1. Pure tamasic people would never benefit from astrology as they will not work to achieve anything and therefore the four purusharthas, dharma, artha, kaama and moksha,were meaningless for them.<br/> 
    2. For tamasic -rajasic people astrology was useful but in a very limited way.<br/> 
    3. For unsuccessful rajasic people astrology has lot of use for periodical guidance,<br/> 
    4. It is the dynamically rajasic people that made the best use of astrology. It is the horoscope of these people that should interest astrologers most for studies.<br/> 
    5. Rajasic-sattwick people made good use of astrology sometime but their dependence on astrology decreases as they grow richer spiritually with advancing years.<br/> 
    6. Pure sattwick people hardly needed astrology for their lives because of their rich inner life in which they get immersed.<br/> 
    7. The gunateeta or transcendental people who live in exalted spiritual state do not need astrology at all.<br/> 
    It is difficult to say who should make use of astrology as almost every human being would need astrological guidance to show him a way out of the maze of the uncertainties of life. <br/> 
    It is however for three groups that astrology acquires positive meaning and importance tamasic-rajasic, unsuccessful rajasic people and the dynamically rajasic people need and use it most.<br/>
